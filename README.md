# License_Plate_Detection_and_Character_Recognition
In this project we have implemented license plate detection of different vehicles in different complicated scenes using computer vision(image processing).</br>
After detecting the plate area, we implemented segmentation and recognized the characters using OCR(in-built MATLAB library).</br>
Then we also took another dataset of number plates for character recognition using OCR. We did this to check the accuracy of OCR. And we got satisfactory results.
